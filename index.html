    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      SpotOut is a small, local, and independent company run by Frank and Jena Pablo. We’ve been around since 2018 and our main area of service is Grand Rapids and the surrounding areas. We never signed on to be professional babysitters of large crews. We decided to start doing our cleaning jobs ourselves because most technicians simply could not provide the same level of service that we pride ourselves on.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
      When you hire SpotOut, you never deal with any lazy employees or subcontractors, or with any pricing games or gimmicks… you just get amazing, old-fashioned service with high end modern equipment. We run our business efficiently and we pride ourselves on giving you great value! If you have never tried our service, we invite you to join the ranks of our existing clients who trust us for the highest quality work for a fair price.
